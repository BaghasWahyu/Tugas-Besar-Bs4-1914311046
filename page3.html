crimes committed in Southeast Asia, not isolated incidents but crimes committed
on a day-to-day basis with the full awareness of officers at all levels of
command. It's impossible to describe to you exactly what did happen in Detroit,
the emotions in the room, the feelings of the men who were reliving their
experiences in Vietnam, but they did. They relived the absolute horror of what
this country, in a sense, made them do. They told the stories at times they had
personally raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, taped wires from portable
telephones to human genitals and turned up the power, cut off limbs, blown up
bodies, randomly shot at civilians, razed villages in fashion reminiscent of
Genghis Khan, shot cattle and dogs for fun, poisoned food stocks, and generally
ravaged the countryside of South Vietnam in addition to the normal ravage of war
and the normal and very particular ravaging which is done by the applied bombing
power of this country."
