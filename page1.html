thought it was going to be different,' as did the Congress, by the way, members

Knowing what I know today, we still would have gone on into Iraq. We still would
have gone to make our country more secure. He had the capability of making
weapons. He had terrorist ties. The decision I made was the right decision. The
world is better off without Saddam Hussein in power. And I find it interesting,
